# GenAI Website

This is a project by me for a school competition. I originally just had HTML and CSS. Then I wanted to improve it so I migrated to Parcel. You could say it's still incomplete as I have lots of stuff to add and fix.

## Inspiration

I got the design idea from OpenAI's older website. I tried to build it with my own tweaks and a lighter approach.

## Why no JS?

JS wasn't allowed in the competition ;(
